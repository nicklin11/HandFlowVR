# HandFlowVR
HandFlowVR is an open-source hand tracking program with virtual reality (VR) integration. This project leverages computer vision techniques using Python, Mediapipe, and OpenCV to accurately detect and track hand movements in real-time video frames. The tracked hand movements are then seamlessly integrated with popular VR devices, enabling users to interact with virtual environments using their hands.

Key Features:

Real-time hand tracking using Mediapipe and OpenCV.\n
Integration with VR devices such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and more.\n
Emulation of VR controller inputs based on tracked hand movements.\n
Gesture recognition and mapping for intuitive and immersive interactions.\n
Customizable configuration options for sensitivity, calibration, and gesture mappings.\n
Compatibility with popular VR software platforms and game engines.\n
This project aims to provide developers with a foundation for implementing hand tracking and VR integration in their own applications.\n With HandFlowVR, you can unlock new possibilities for natural and immersive interaction within virtual environments, enhancing the overall VR experience.
